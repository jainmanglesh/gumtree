gumtree technical test

#how to run
The technical test is implemented using spring boot.
#1. clone the repository.
#2. Run test from CustomerDetailsServiceTest class.

#Assumption made
#1. First name to be unique. 
    As of now first name is considered as unique however it cannot be, so we need to consider more than one field to make a customer model (object) unique to find two customer to get the age difference. From the address book there are not enough keys to make object unique.
#2. Date is changed to four digit format.
#3 Junit test are provided to check the functionality of implemented methods.
